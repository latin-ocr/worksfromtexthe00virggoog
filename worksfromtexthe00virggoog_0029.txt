The style, for sweetness and for beauty, occasionally, and iu the author's
finisbed passages, 1111111111 almost every other productiou 11 antiquity. ‘⁴ I see
no foundation,¹’ says Dr. Blair, “for 1111 1111111 entertained by some 1111111
1111 111 AEueid 11 to be considered a's an allegorical poem, which carries acon·
stant reference to the character and reign of Augustus Oasar3 or that Virgil’a
main design in composiug the AEneid was to 111111111 111 Romans to tha
govemment of that 111111, who is supposed to be shadowed out under the
. character 11 AEneas. . . . . He had sufficient motivas, as 1 poet, to determine
him to the choico of bis subject, from its being in itself both great aud pleasing3
from ita being suited tobis genius, and its being attended with peculias ad·
vantages 111 the full display of poetical 1111111.”ι -

The first six books 11 1111 AErreicl are the most elaborate part of the poem.
The imperfectione of the AEaeid are alleged to be want of originality in soma
of the prinolpal soenes, and defectivoness iu the exhibition of character. Tbat
11 Dido is by far 111 most decided and complete. But Voltaire has justly
observed upon the strange confusion of interest cxcited by the story of the vvars
iu Italy, in which one is contiuually tempted to esponse the cause of Turnus
rather thau that of AEneas3 and to which 111 exquisite soenes for displayiug
the tenderness of the poet in narrating the story of Lavinia, seem to bave been
bis only temptation]

Virgil, having just revised aud altered the Bucolics and Georgica, projected,
with ariew to giving tbe ultimate polish to the AEaeid, which be had now com-
pleted, a tour in Greece and Asia. With a dread almost prophetie, and an

ardour not disproportionate, Horace addressed the sbip which bore his departing
friend :—

Sic te Diva potens Cypri,

Sic fratres Helenae, lucida sidera,
Ventorumque regat pater,

Obstrictis allis, praeter Iapyga,
Navis, quae tibi creditum

Debes Virgilium, finibus Atticis
Reddas incolumem, precor,

Et serves auimae dimidium meae l ²

1111111 the poet met with Angustus, who was returning from Samos, where
ba had wintered after his -Syrian expedition, to Rome. Obanging his former
intention, Virgll determined to accompauy his patron. On avisit to Megara
ha was seized with a sudden indisposition, which his voyage increased, and hs
died a few days after his arrival at Brundusium,³ in his fifty-second year.
