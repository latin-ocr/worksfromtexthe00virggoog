XXX BIOGRAPHIOAL MEMOIR OF VIRGIIt.

Carvilius Pictor, in imitation of his worthy prototype Zoilus, composed
AEnet'domcstis. Bavins arrd Maevius, proverbial names for the impersonati
of united dulncss, envy, and calumny, attacked Virgi13 and Cornificius, also
appears to have written against him. Virgil is said to have retaliated arula
the name of Amyntas, in his Alexis and Daphnis,1 Bnt the most triumphan-
refntation of his adversaries has been the judgment of posterity. No writer

- probably, cvcr exercised so wide an influence either in time or space. His wo :-

became forthwith,² and still remain, text-books and school-hooks3 they were ev ·
translated into Greek, they were commented on by a cloud of grammarians3
they were the subject of innumerahle epigrama, they were formed into centos
they were used for the purposes of divination. Virgil was the model of th
Carlovingian poets; the “Magnus Apollo’¹ of the chivalrous Von Veldeck·
Dante exulted in his guidance; and the later poetry of all Europeans has don
homage to his supremacy.

In person, according to Donatus, Virgil was tall; his complexion was darlr
k . his expression rustic, his manners shy, and of almost feminine modesty. Thes
particulare may very well be traditional. allusion has been already made to ι ·-
magical powers ascribed to him, and, as a matter of curiosity, and illustrativ
of the ideas which prevailed concerning him in the middle ages, some of atha
fables may be appended. Nono of them are probably older than the llth oen
tury. According, then, to his mediaeval chroniclers,Virgil became acquainted wi ι
necromancy by the assistance of an evil spirit, who promised to instruct him ι
the art so that he should never be surpassed‚ on condition of being liberated fron

ΤΙιθ challenge was accepted3 but no sooner was the demon in the eave th
Virgil closed it upon him. The story is probably derived from an brabian tra
dition. Virgil's first necromantic exploit was the erection of the city of llaplaa¹
which he built ona foundation of eggs. On a square tower which he constructe*
there, he so balanced an egg, that, when it stirred, the city would he shakcn wit
