rene ιο whom the Cnlrr is addressed, he cannot he the Octavius of whose
opinion Horace speaks so highly in the Xth Satire of his Ist Book, since the
Cetelertn were, according tn Donatus's account, eompleted when Virgil was
iiten years oi age.1 From the dedication, tlte poet proceeds tn a most glcwing
description of sannae, and a gnatherd driving his flock atield: and thence talree
nutriente indulge in a long digression en the happiness of rural lile, which,
though less polished, is more winning and pathetic than the corresponding
perage in the Georgius. He has not, indeed, surpassed in intensity ni relish fcr
the muntry his great model Lucretius; bnt he has amplified him with great
terte and independence, and thie passage, taken all in all,is ene of the most
virid md deliniens in the whole range of Latin Poetry. From this, Virgrl
retum ιο his short narrative. The neon approaehes, and his mstic hero seelrs
the sheltm oi a grove tn enjoy his eiecta While he is sleeping, a serpent is on
thepnint of destroying him, when a gnat, perceiring his danger, gives notice to
mr bys timely sting. Emagedwith the iurem, oiwhose benevolent intention he
isignnrmt, he instantly ernshes him. At night, however, the shade ol the gnat
nmen ιο him, and, aller a poetical but tedicus description of the regions ef the
tantm, reproaches him sor his ingratitude. In this passage the reader may
trecha sketches from which Virgil afterwards drew his finished pictures ei the
metues of Hector, and the descents of Orpheus and AEneas. The goutherd,
m awaking, as the only compensation in his power, erecte a monument to his

macer, with an inscription, which concludes the poem:

Parve Culex, pecudum custos tibi tale merenti
Funeris officium vitae pro munere reddit.

'lle character oi lhrgil, as drawn by Asconius Pedianus, and preserved to us
byllnnatus,is eminently pleasing. He is there represented as kind in disposition,
cutm tc the learned and the virtuens, free from all envy, and delighted with
lleiiternry success ol others no less than with his ewn; blnming none, and praising
he gcud3 and so affable in manner, that none but the mest perverse could fail
tite, and eren leve him. He seemed to consider nothing his own; his library
idenged as much to his literary friends as to himself 3 and he otien quoted the
tinge in Euripides, rol rire φίλων κοινά. By this amiahle and conciliatery lite,
lt established himself in the esteem of all the most eminent of his literary con·

Frum Donatus, however, we leam that Anser declined his acquaintance srom
party consideratione, being himself attached ιο hntony‚ in whose praiee he com-
pared a poem. Yet the splendour ol Virgil's success attracted many to perish in

the blare which they songht tn extinguish. 0n the appearance of his Bucolica,
