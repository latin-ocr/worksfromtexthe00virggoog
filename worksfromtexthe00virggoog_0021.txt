imperial Rome was ill suited to convey the uuprcmeditated effusione of unlettered
herdsman. if virgil, therefore, has fallen very far short of his great prototypo,
the difficulty of his attempt must not be forgotten. indeed, he appears not in·
sensible of it himself ς and, hythe nature os the language in which he composed,
he bas been compelled to abendon his original intention, and to attempt loffier
fligbts than the nature of pastoral poetry strictly justifies.

· The Eclogues of Virgii possess one remarkable characteristic, they are alle·
gorius. This at once introduces a great differeuce between them and the Theo-
critcan idyl. The allegorical veil is sometimes allowed to fall, and the shepherds
who represent the poet aud his friends converse like scholare und plrilosophers.
It has been a great question, whether the Alexis partakes of this figurative
character3 many are of opinion that it is merely an imitation of the Ἐρασταῖς
of Τ heocritus. hii the grammarians, however, identify the poet with Corydon,
aud there is the higher authority of his contemporary, Propertius, as well aa
those of Martial and Apulejus, on the same side ;ι but the real name of Alexis is
amatter of considerable doubt. The opinion mentioned by Servius, that Augustus
was intended, scarcely deserves to be noticed. Some make Alexis to lrave been
Alexander, a slave of Pollio; but most probably be belonged to hierenae

, Paiuful doubts overhang this portion of Virgil’s history 3² but J urenul most aa·

suredly did not make any allusion to the subject in the following lines, which

Dryden has most grossly empliiied and perverted :³-

—- si Virgilio puer et tolerabile deesset
Hospitium, caderent ornnes e crinibus hydri,—
Surda nibil gemeret grove buccina.

There is difficulty in believing thie to have been the first of Virgil's compositione,
on the supposition os Alexis being the slave either of Maeeenas or Augustus,
inasnruch as, in that case, it must have been written before we have any account
of Virgil's acquaintance with either.

But the most extraordinary composition of Virgil is his Pollio, a poem which
