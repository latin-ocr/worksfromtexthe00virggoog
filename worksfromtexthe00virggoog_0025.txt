ing to common repert, to a certain Maximinian, who donrisbed in the time of
Roitius. As an elegiae poet, Gallus rauked very high in public opinion. Ovid
speaks of his fame as universa13 Propertius and Martial bave borne testimony
to bis excellence; and Virgil, in his beautiful and extraordinary l'lth Eclogns,
bas panegyrired his Euphorion in the noblest strains of mythological eulcgy.
Virgil bad also, according to Servius, celebrated his praises in the conclusion of
bis Georgica. Gallus was no less distinguished as a warrior than as a poet3 lrs
was of great service to Augustus in the Egyptian war, and assisted in securing
tbe person of Cleopatra. Hc was, in consequence, constituted the first prefect
of Egypt. Here he appears to have conducted himself with arrogance and in·
solenne. He was afterwards condemned to banishment by the command cf
Angustus, on suspiciones having conspired against him 3 a sentence which, bovr-
ever, the poet anticipated by a rolnrrtary death, tac. 7283 arrd Virgil, at the
instance of the emperor, substituted for his eulogy on Gallus the fable of Aris·
loeus.

. The publication of Virgil's Bucolica created a powerful sensatior in literary
Rome. The grammarians tell us that they were recited on tbe stage;¹ and
theton one occasion, when Cicero was present in the theatre, and heard some
verses of the Silenus recited by Cytheris, he called for tlre whole eclogae, and,
when he had heard it through, exclaimed, “hfupnoe spes ultera Roma-’³
This cannot be true, for Cicero was then dead: but we have better authority
for tbs trutb of the honours publicly lavished on virgil. Prom the author of tha
Dialogus de Oratoribus² we learn that, when some verses of Virgil were recited
on the stage, and the poet happened to be present, all the spectatore rose, and
paid him the same marks of respect which they would have shown to Augustus.
Propertius³ has celebrated the conclusion aad publication of the Bucolica, and
Ovid⁴ has soretold their immortality.

The poetieal power which the Bncolies discovered indueed hlaecenas, almost
as soon as they were finished (about tac. 717), to nequest Virgil to undertalre
the Georgica. Tbe neglected state of agriculture, in consequence of the civil
wara, might bc the reason why hlaecenas chose this subject for Virgil’s Musa:

and indeed this conditional the country is graphieally described hythe poet
himself: ⁵

Ubi fas remeatque nefas3 tot bella per orbem,
Tam multae scelerum facies: non ullus aratro
Dignus honos: squalent abductis arva colonis,
Et curvae rigidum falces conflantur in ensem.

But we must not suppose the statesman to have conceived that the military
aettlcrs could be mored by an exquisite poem to the cultivation of their estates.
