Catullus. One Epigram, intitulcd Votum pro susceptd AEaeide‚ will not bs
ungratesul to the reader :

Si mihi susceptum suerit decurrere munus,
0 Paphon, ὃ sedes quas colis Idalias!
Troius AEneas Romana per oppida digno
darn tandem ut tecum carmine vectus eat:
Non ego thure modd, aut picta tua templa tabelli
Ornabo, et puris serta ieram manibus:
Corniger hos aries humiles et maxima taurus
Victima sacratos tinget honore focos,
Marmoreusque tibi, Dea, versicoloribus alis,
In morem pictis stabit Amor pharetra.
Adsis, ὃ Cytherea! tuus te Caesar Olympo,
Et Surrentini litoris ora vocant.

It is scarcely necessary to distinguish the Catulario from the Eptyrammara
The nature of the Priapeia it is obviously unuceessary to investigate. The
work now extant under that title is, substantially, augustan, but tho character
of Virgil forbids us to suppose that his pen has contributed to it in any im-
portant degree. The Dirae is a poem attributed more correctly to Valerius
(lato. The Moratum is a pisce of very peculiar beauty; and approaches nn z
to Theocritus in spirit than any ol the Bucolica. It bears also a remarkabl
resemblance to Bloomfield’s Farmer’s Boy. It is a lively description ol a rustic’
day, and takes its name from ahiud ol saled, called Moratum, the making oi
which is described in it. Tbe Capu is a Bacchanalian invitation, in the perso
of a Copa, or Syrian woman, who attended, as a dancer or singcr, on houscso
public anacronismum-‘² Ambubaiarum colleyia.’'

Os all the minor poenas, however, ascribed to Virgil, the Culex is, lor man ·
reasons, the best deserving notice. ll'hatevcr doubts may bc thrown ou th
genuineness of the others, there seems to be every reason lor believing that thi
poem, allowiug for all its grass and manifold corruptions, is the work ol Virg‘
That Virgil wrote a poem bearing this name cannot be questioned3 for, beside
the testimony of Donatus and Servius, we have the more respectable evidens
of Martial,¹ Statius,² aud Lucan,³ for the fact. Donatus quotes two verses frou
the poem, aad Nonius Marcellus one, which are found in the extant copies
The poem, however, seems to have suffered much from alterations and iuter
poltations. Allowing far these, it must bave boen a very beautiful productiori

and by far the most original effert of Virgil’s blase. It opens with a dedicatio
to Octavius3 who this Octavius was is amatter of uncertainty. In the Cata
lecta mention is made of a certain Octavius who died in a paroxysm of ang·
occasioned by drinking3 ii this person be, as some commentators suppose, th
