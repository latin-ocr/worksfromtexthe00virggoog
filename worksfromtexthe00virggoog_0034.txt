. tahon os renovating his youth hy enchantment3 and, with this view, erceted a

malle in a lonely spot, iu the perch of which he set twenty-four copper statues,
armcd with iren daile, twelve on each eide, which tbrcshed contiunally‚ except
aben he withheld them. Hither hc conducted a servant, aud, leading him into
eroon lighted by a perpetual lamp, bade him hill him, cut the body in picces,
nophe it in a barrel, for the eil os the lamp to drop upon for nine days, alter
whiob l'lrgil was to eome sorth a youth. The lamp was, notwithstanding, to

mdeaequainted with the method of stopping the flails, and visited the apart-
um every day te replenish the lamp. At length the Emperor, missing Virgil
homocum, threatened the servant with death if he did not convey him to his

Such is a specimen ol the extraordinary absurdities wherewith mediaeval
nn'ten have overlaid the biography of Virgil. It is, however, but a very slight
ltdoe ot the mythology connected with 'the subject. Many fabulous inventione
tre omitted, and those which have been adduced have been merely ehetched, as
nne readers may deem even these slender particulare unworthy of allusion in a
ttiens though compendious biography. They have, however, in the writer's
eddon, thcir velue-they show the high reputation which the name of Virgil

ἱ lugil’s mathematioal and physical studies may have had possibly some influcnce

heriginating the fables reported of him, yet the general celebrity of his writings,
bejudgment of ancient critics, and the estimate which the learned were still
dnn lorm of his werke, are sufficient to account for the phenomcnon. These
blas, in trutb, only speak the langnage of one to whom they perhaps were, and
hd subiect certainly was, amply familiar:
