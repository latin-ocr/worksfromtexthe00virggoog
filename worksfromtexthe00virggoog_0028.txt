ιιιιιιι, bepertinent ιο remark, that, smooth aad nnisorm as its surface seems,

md superhnman character, to awaken their admiration aud their avve. No
suffiae could have been more happily ohoscn. lt has been admired too ior its
peden uuity of action, for while the episodes command the richest variety ol
description, they are always subordinated to the main object of the poem, which
