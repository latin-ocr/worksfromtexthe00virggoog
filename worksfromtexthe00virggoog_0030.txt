uumng to Donatus he composed his epitaph, ιο he inscribed on his tomb at
haples, whitber he deaired his body ιο be oonvcyed for burial:

Mantua me genuit3 Calabri rapuere3 tenet nunc
Parthenope, cecini pascua, rura, duces.

ht intercal evidence militates forcibly against the ascription of these verses.

huruuey desired that hia AEceid, as an imperfect work, might be berned,
nd aven left in his will an injunction ιο that effect. Being, however, informed

¹ duce in his journey to Brundusium) that Arignotus would not permit the
&usion of bis poem, he left it to them to publish‚ on condition that they
mh snake no additions to the text, even for the purpose of supplying an
mahen verse. How fur his executore were faithful ιο their trust must now
