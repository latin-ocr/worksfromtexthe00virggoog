the general expectation of such aPerson then prevalent in the hest.1 It is also
remarkable that AElian mentions the Juvv1sn Smin, together with the Cumaeam?
her eracles, therefore, which were probably in substance the same as the pro·
phetical writings, were likely to be in the collection. Dionysius of Halicarnassus,
on the authority of Varro, asserta that such of the prophecies as were not genuine
were written in acrostiehs.³ Eusebius has preserved a pretended acrostich oraclo
of tha Erythraean Sibyl, the initial letters of which form the words ΙΗΣΟΥΣ
ΧΡΙΣΤΟΣ ΘΕΟΥ ΥΙΟΣ ΣΩΤΗΡ maroa, but this is evidentlya for·
geryon the bare inspection. We have culpi used for mankind, εἴδωλα for idola,
and in one place the very words of Scriptura bave been quoted: “ &pirric τ’ ia
aelurus ἔσται acal βρύγμος obdurare„ Constantine, in his “ Λόγος τῷ τῶν
ἁγίων aenaeam gives a very elaborate interpretation of the Pollio, with a
Greek translation of tha greater part of it, and asserta that the oracle, whence it
was taken, was translated by Cicero into Latin verse, and annexed ιο his poema.
We have now no traco of thie translation, if it ever existed 3 but it is a curione
circumstance, that Cicero informs us that the Sibyllino oraoles did predict alring,
and were written in acrosticha⁴ If any name vvere mentioned in thern, it must
bave been Cornelius3 as the pretence which Lentulus adduccd for bis connection
with Catilina was a Sibyllina propheoy, portending that the empire of Rome was
to be given ιο three Cornelii ‚⁵ Cinna and Sylla having been the two former, the
third was to be himself. It is by no means improbable that, among the pro·
phecies copied from the Jewish Scriptores, or gleaned from Jewish tradition,
which were in all probability found among the Sibyllina writings, the great Sub·
ject of prediction was called ld 333, tlte power of Gora which would assurcdly
have been translated Cornelius by the Romam. '

The author of the ingenious and elaborate Observatiooa, who conceivcs that
Virgil meant to refer the Sibyl's prediction ιο Angustus, imagines the whole
poem to be a metrical horoscope, and discovers a clear explanation of eve ⁴
expression and allusion contained in it, by a reference ιο the phrascology ο
astrological art. How far this author is bigoted to hypothesis, may be conjec-
tured from his application of the following lines ιο the sign Aries:
